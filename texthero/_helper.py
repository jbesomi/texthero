    Decorator to handle NaN values in a function's input.

    Using the decorator, if there are NaNs in the input,
    they are replaced with replace_nans_with
    and a warning is printed.

    The function must take as first input a Pandas Series.

    --------
    >>> from texthero._helper import handle_nans
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> import numpy as np
