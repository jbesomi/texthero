Hero Series Types
=================

There are different kinds of Pandas Series used in the library, depending on use.
For example, the functions in preprocessing.py usually take as input a Series
where every cell is a string, and return as output a Series where every cell
is a string. To make handling the different types easier (and most importantly
intuitive for users), this file implements the types as subclasses of Pandas
Series and defines functions to check the types.

The goal is to be able to do something like this:

@OutputSeries(RepresentationSeries)
@InputSeries(TokenSeries)
def tfidf(s: TokenSeries) -> RepresentationSeries:
    ...

The decorator (@...) makes python check whether the input is
of correct form/type,
and whether the output is of correct form/type,
which leads to easier code and exception handling (no need to write
"if not is_text_series(s): raise ..." in every function) and easy
modification/expansion later on.

The typing helps the users understand the code more easily
as they'll be able to see immediately from the documentation
on what types of Series a function operates. This is much more
verbose and clearer than e.g. "tfidf(s: pd.Series) -> pd.Series".

Note that users can and should of course still simply 
use ordinary pd.Series objects. The custom types are just subclasses of pd.Series so
we can easily use them in the code.

This is mainly for
- ease of development: just put the correct decorators and
don't think about printing errors for incorrect types
- ease of use / understanding: better typing/documentation for users


These are the implemented types:

- TextSeries: cells are text (i.e. strings), e.g. "Test"
- TokenSeries: cells are lists of tokens (i.e. lists of strings), e.g. ["word1", "word2"]
- VectorSeries: cells are vector representations of text, e.g. [0.25, 0.75]
- RepresentationSeries: Series is multiindexed with level one
being the document, level two being the individual features and their values

The classes are lightweight subclasses of pd.Series and serve 2 purposes:
1. Good documentation for users through docstring.
2. Function to check if a pd.Series has the required properties.

    Hero Series Types
    =================
    In texthero, most functions operate on a Pandas Series as input
    and give a Pandas Series as output. There are currently four
    main types of Series' in use, which are supported as classes
    by the library:

    1. TextSeries: Every cell is a text, i.e. a string. For example,
    `pd.Series(["test", "test"])` is a valid TextSeries.

    2. TokenSeries: Every cell is a list of words/tokens, i.e. a list
    of strings. For example, `pd.Series([["test"], ["token2", "token3"]])` is a valid TokenSeries.

    3. VectorSeries: Every cell is a vector representing text, i.e.
    a list of floats. For example, `pd.Series([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0]])` is a valid VectorSeries.

    4. RepresentationSeries: Series is multiindexed with level one
    being the document, level two being the individual features and their values.
    For example,
    `pd.Series([1, 2, 3], index=pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples([("doc1", "word1"), ("doc1", "word2"), ("doc2", "word1")]))`
    is a valid RepresentationSeries.

    These types of Series are supposed to make using the library
    easier and more intuitive. For example, if you see a
    function head
    ```
    def tfidf(s: TokenSeries) -> RepresentationSeries
    ```
    then you know that the function takes a Pandas Series
    whose cells are lists of strings (tokens) and will
    return a Pandas Series whose cells are vectors of floats.
