    """
    Return named-entities.

    Return a Pandas Series where each row contains a list of tuples
    with information about the named entities in the row's document.

    Tuple: (`entity'name`, `entity'label`, `starting character`, `ending character`)

    Under the hood, `named_entities` makes use of 
    `Spacy name entity recognition <https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#named-entities>`_

    List of labels:
     - `PERSON`: People, including fictional.
     - `NORP`: Nationalities or religious or political groups.
     - `FAC`: Buildings, airports, highways, bridges, etc.
     - `ORG` : Companies, agencies, institutions, etc.
     - `GPE`: Countries, cities, states.
     - `LOC`: Non-GPE locations, mountain ranges, bodies of water.
     - `PRODUCT`: Objects, vehicles, foods, etc. (Not services.)
     - `EVENT`: Named hurricanes, battles, wars, sports events, etc.
     - `WORK_OF_ART`: Titles of books, songs, etc.
     - `LAW`: Named documents made into laws.
     - `LANGUAGE`: Any named language.
     - `DATE`: Absolute or relative dates or periods.
     - `TIME`: Times smaller than a day.
     - `PERCENT`: Percentage, including ”%“.
     - `MONEY`: Monetary values, including unit.
     - `QUANTITY`: Measurements, as of weight or distance.
     - `ORDINAL`: “first”, “second”, etc.
     - `CARDINAL`: Numerals that do not fall under another type.
